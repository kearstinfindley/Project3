- What else do you need covered in this class? 
  # Maybe some basics on how to set up spreadsheets/data to put into R (formating, what basic characters are considered "special characters" in R that might cause problems). 
  # Also, when I get errors I try googling my issues and it never really seems to help me very much. Is there a better way to search errors other than just copy and pasting the error code you get, or are there specific websites that have user friendly tips?
  - Is anyone else in your lab doing similar analyses?
  # Everyone in our lab is using R to do different things, but we all generally need to make a map at some point, so the mapping we have learned how to do in leaflet would be a useful skill amongst us all. 
  - Do you think in the future, there will be other students working on your question in your lab?
  #I don't know if anyone will be working on similar research in the future, but the things I have been using R for in my dataset are things that someone would most definitely find useful working with their data (mapping, converting coordinates, plotting abiotic data, etc.).
